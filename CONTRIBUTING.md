# How to contribute to pdf-template-parse [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

If you would like to get involved or chat about the project checkout the issue board or join the gitter chat.

Always make sure to be nice and follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## How to start

1. head over to the [issues board](https://github.com/tomrule007/pdf-template-parse/issues) and create an issue or comment on a current one.
2. Fork the project (read more about [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo))
3. create a branch (currently loosely following these [git name conventions](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848#file-gistfile1-md))

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to tomrule007/pdf-template-parse](https://github.com/tomrule007/pdf-template-parse/pull/new/development) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## coding conventions

(anyone want to get started here? I'm currently thinking eslint w/ airbnb config needs to be added to the project but I'm open to suggestions)
